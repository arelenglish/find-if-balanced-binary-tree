#Programming Exercises

This is a repository of solutions to programming exercises in multiple languages. Some of the 
exercises are solved multiple times in different languages. 

######Javascript
[Find if a string has all unique characters](javascript/has-all-uniq-chars.js) 

[given two strings, find if they are permutations of eachother](javascript/permutation-finder.js)

[Compress a string of alphabetical characters](javascript/string_compressor.js)

[Percent Ecnode a String, both stripping white space and keeping it](javascript/percent-encoding-string.js)

######Ruby
[Find if a binary tree is balanced](ruby/is_balanced_tree.rb)

[A very simple doubly-linked list class](ruby/linked_list.rb)

[Compress a string of alphabetical characters](ruby/string_compressor.rb)

[A Binary Tree and Node Class that automatically sorts new nods into the correct position in the tree](ruby/binary_tree.rb)

######C

[A doubly linked list](c/double_linked_list.c)

######Go
I didn't write the go code, it's from [https://golang.org/pkg/container/list/](https://golang.org/pkg/container/list/) 
I was going to write a doubly linked list, but go already implements it so well. I'll put some real go programming 
exercises up here after I do them. 

[A doubly linked list](go/double_linked_list.go)

######Python
[Format a text file of addresses into organized JSON output](https://github.com/arelenglish/rolodex)
